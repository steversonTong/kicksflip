- A safe and secure way to trade your sneakers online!
- Online shoe trading service
- sneaker trading platform that allows users to store all their collection of shoes and make their choice of shoes public for trade offers
- we are the middle man for checking authenticity and safe way for trading shoes
- in person trading can be risky with scams, fake shoes, health safety, etc. SO:
  - Customer will have to choice to do an in person meet up where we MUST track each customer location (free of cost ofc)
  - However we will incentivize to online trading where it's more safe and they will have a legit checker (have to pay fee)
    - Parties can decide how or what to trade through a messaging system. If money is involved in the trade, there will be a account balance where it will be pending until both parties receive their shoes
    - If both parties want to make a trade, one party has to click “want to trade” and write out a comment of what trade is happening (the specifics of the shoes and trade offer for us the middle man to know what to look for). The other party would then have to accept the offer and both parties would then have to accept terms and conditions.
    - Both parties will have to ship in their shoes and we will handle the rest from there
    - If something happens to trade, like a fake shoe or trade condition not met, we will terminate the trade offer and send the shoes back to original traders. However the party that trades a fake shoes or did not meet trade conditions will be charge
  - Or user can use this as just a closet to keep track of their sneaker or make it public without trades to flex (user will need to have a picture of their shoe)
